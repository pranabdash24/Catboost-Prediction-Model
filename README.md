This project focuses on addressing a common challenge faced by fitness centers—member retention—by applying advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques. Conducted for the University of Birmingham Sports and Fitness Centre, the project aims to predict member behavior during the critical initial 90-day period, often referred to as the "honeymoon phase."

The core objective is to identify members at risk of disengaging and predict their activity levels, enabling the development of targeted engagement strategies to increase retention. The study involved analyzing a comprehensive dataset comprising gym and pool attendance, class bookings, and membership details.

Key Steps in the Project:
Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:
Raw data was cleaned, standardized, and enriched by creating features like activity levels and membership duration. Special emphasis was placed on capturing the nuances of member behavior in the first 90 days.

Clustering for Member Segmentation:
Using techniques like K-means clustering, members were grouped into distinct profiles based on their activity patterns. For instance:

Dedicated Gym Users: Frequent gym-goers with minimal interest in other activities.
Casual Users: Members with sporadic engagement across activities.
Class & Squash Enthusiasts: Active participants in group activities but less engaged in solo gym sessions.
Predictive Modeling:
Multiple machine learning algorithms, including CatBoost and Random Forest, were employed to predict two key outcomes:

Whether a new member would remain active beyond 90 days.
The activity level of members during their initial membership period.
The CatBoost model emerged as the most effective, with high accuracy and interpretability, highlighting features such as price level, age, and membership type as critical predictors.
Deployment:
The predictive models were deployed using Streamlit, creating an intuitive interface for the Sports Centre staff. This interface enables real-time predictions and simplifies complex analytics for non-technical users.

Key Achievements:
Developed actionable insights for improving member retention by identifying at-risk members and tailoring strategies for distinct member profiles.
Enhanced the accessibility of predictive analytics through a user-friendly deployment platform.
Provided practical recommendations for incorporating qualitative data, such as surveys, to better understand member motivations and satisfaction.
This project not only addresses a critical business need for the University of Birmingham Sports and Fitness Centre but also contributes valuable insights to the broader fitness industry by demonstrating the potential of predictive analytics in customer retention strategies.
